#  ðŸš‰ SDE API Round - IRCTC
Hey there, Mr. X. You have been appointed to design a railway management system like IRCTC, where users can come on the platform and
check if there are any trains available between 2 stations.
The app will also display how many seats are available between any 2 stations and the user can book a seat if the availability > 0 after
logging in. Since this has to be real-time and multiple users can book seats simultaneously, your code must be optimized enough to handle
large traffic and should not fail while doing any bookings.
If more than 1 users simultaneously try to book seats, only either one of the users should be able to book. Handle such race conditions
while booking.
There is a Role Based Access provision and 2 types of users would exist :
1. Admin - can perform all operations like adding trains, updating total seats in a train, etc.
2. Login users - can check availability of trains, seat availability, book seats, get booking details, etc.

## Schema
Tables | Attributes
------------ | -------------
admin | username(PK), password
user | username(PK), name, email, address, password
train | t_number(PK), t_date(PK), num_ac, num_sleeper, released_by(FK - admin)
train_status | t_number(FK - train, PK), t_date(FK - train, PK), seats_b_ac, seats_b_sleeper
ticket | pnr_no(PK), coach, booked_by(FK - user), booked_at, t_number(FK - train), t_date(FK - train) 
passenger | name, age, gender, pnr_no(PK, FK - ticket), berth_no(PK), berth_type, coach_no(PK)

## Triggers

    - Operation - BEFORE UPDATE
    - 	Table - train_status
    - Checks booked seats are not more than available seats in both AC & Sleeper Coach
- before_berth_assign
    - Operation - BEFORE INSERT
    - Table - passenger
    - Checks, whether the berth number & coach number assigned, is already assigned to some other passenger for the same train number and date of journey and coach(AC/Sleeper) or not


## Assumptions Made
- Admins are added to the table manually.
    - There are 2 admins in the system - admin, admin1(password is same as username)
- Trains can be released at least 1 month before and at most 4 months before the journey date.
- Users can book tickets at most 2 months in advance.
- Number of passengers attribute is not added in the table - ticket as number of passengers associated with a particular ticket can be found by using the following query - 

```
SELECT ticket.pnr_no, COUNT(*) as num_passengers
FROM ticket, passenger
WHERE ticket.pnr_no = passenger.pnr_no
GROUP BY ticket.pnr_no;
```

## Validations 
- Login (Admin & User)
    - Username - Not Empty & Valid
    - Password - Not Empty & Valid
- Register
    - Password - minimun 8 characters
    - Username - Contain letters only, Shouldn't Already Taken
    - Full Name, Address - Not Empty
    - Email - Valid, Not Empty, Shouldn't Already Registered
- Release Train
    - Train Number - Not Empty & Number
    - Date - Not Empty & Between CURRENT_DATE + 1 Month & CURRENT_DATE + 4 Month
    - Number of Coaches - Positive & Total should be >= 1

## Other Functionalities

- View All Released Trains 
    - Both admins and users can see the details (train number, date of journey, number of AC & sleeper coaches) of all released trains.
- Check Train Status
    - Both admins and users can view the number of seats available for booking by entering a valid train number & date of journey.- 
- View All Users
    - Admins can see the details of all users registered in the system.
- View All Bookings
    - Admins can also view details of bookings made by all the users.
- View Previous Bookings
